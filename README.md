Degree Recognizer is a machine learning project that automatically selects the best degree for polynomial regression and the optimal regularization parameter (`alpha`) to minimize error on a given dataset. This project is aimed at automating the tedious process of hyperparameter tuning, providing a streamlined solution for regression problems.

## Features

- **Dataset Handling:** Load and preprocess datasets for regression tasks.
- **Regularization Selection:** Automatically determine the best `alpha` value for regularization.
- **Degree Optimization:** Find the optimal polynomial degree for the regression model.
- **Visualization:** Generate plots to visualize the performance of different models.
- **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation to ensure the generalization of the model.
